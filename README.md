# Networks
Network science is a thriving and increasingly important cross-disciplinary domain that focuses on the representation, analysis and modeling of complex social, biological and technological systems as networks or graphs. Modern data sets often include some kind of network. Nodes can have locations, directions, memory, demographic characteristics, content, and preferences. Edges can have lengths, directions, capacities, costs, durations, and types. And, these variables and the network structure itself can vary, with edges and nodes appearing, disappearing and changing their characteristics over time. Capturing, modeling and understanding networks and rich data requires understanding both the mathematics of networks and the computational tools for identifying and explaining the patterns they contain.
